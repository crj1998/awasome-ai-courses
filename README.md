### [TinyML and Efficient Deep Learning](https://efficientml.ai/)
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
MIT ‚Ä¢ 6.S965 ‚Ä¢ Fall 2022

Have you found it difficult to deploy neural networks on mobile devices and IoT devices? Have you ever found it too slow to train neural networks? This course is a deep dive into efficient machine learning techniques that enable powerful deep learning applications on resource-constrained devices. Topics cover efficient inference techniques, including model compression, pruning, quantization, neural architecture search, and distillation; and efficient training techniques, including distributed training, gradient compression and on-device transfer learning; followed by application-specific model optimization techniques for video, point cloud, GAN and NLP; it will cover futuristic research on quantum machine learning. Students will get hands-on experience implementing deep learning applications on microcontrollers and mobile phones with an open-ended design project related to mobile AI.
